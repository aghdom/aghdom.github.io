# Gardens are meant to be messy

Don't try to keep a digital garden the same way you would a write blog or an essay. 
It goes against the "[ethos of digital gardening](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history#the-six-patterns-of-gardening)".

Notes in it are meant to be planted (written) quickly, and allowed to grow and evolve over time. 

Striving for perfection will only slow you down. It will only make you frustrated.
This can lead to you not tending to the garden as frequently as you'd like, or even abandoning it altogether. 

So [embrace the mess](/garden/embrace-the-mess/)! Write down loose thoughts as they come to you. Work on them over time.

[Make it a habit](/garden/this-website/habit). Never stop tending the garden.
