# Capture the flow of thought

I recently had a thought in the shower. 

It led me down a very interesting flow of thought.

In this flow, I went through a lot of small pockets of knowledge that are currently hidden away in my mind. I picked some thoughts up and continued ever deeper down the rabbit hole.

I enjoyed pulling this thought-strand, and thought that it would be neat to be able to share it with people. Not just the destination, but the journey there as well!
So you can focus in on one of the pockets of knowledge and pick a different thread to follow, should you wish to!

Then I remembered [Andy's notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes) and how they inspired me to start writing down notes on things in the first place.

Which led me to my own website (you're reading it). So I decided that when possible, I'd like to capture the flows of my thoughts around certain topics. This will also give me places to point people to,
should they become interested in a given topic.

And this is the flow of thought, which led me to write this post!
(I'll hopefully write about the original flow that led to this one in the future)
