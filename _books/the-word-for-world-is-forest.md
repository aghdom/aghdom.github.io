This was an unexpected read! I picked it up as something "short & light" to read, but I shouldn't have underestimated Le Guin. This one packs a punch! I was most pleasantly surprised by the focus on what standing up and fighting against an oppressor does to the oppressed, and how it can scar & change an entire civilization.
