An amazing book about the destructive "high conflict", how to recognize it and how to get out and back to healthy constructive conflict.
The author covers all kinds of conflict, from divorce counseling to guerilla warfare in Colombia, showing the underlying similarities and forces at play.

A very important book for this day and age. I believe *everyone* should go and read this book.
