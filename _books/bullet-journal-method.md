Great introduction to [bullet journaling](https://bulletjournal.com/). I especially enjoyed the parts about the "why" behind the practice. It's by no means a miracle cure, but it's a system that has worked well for me for over 5 years now. 
You don't need this book to use the method. It's a nice companion piece, if you wish to learn more.
