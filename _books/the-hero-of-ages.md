A great conclusion to the build-up of the first two books! I love that a lot of the mysteries about koloss, Inquisitors and kandra were answered and not just left vague. I do feel like the last twist happened very quickly and almost out of nowhere, but it was very satisfying nonetheless. I'll say that at time I felt that this last book slightly dragged on in the middle portion, focusing a lot on Spook and Sazed's growth, but in retrospect it makes sense, given the ending. Those characters had to be built up, so that we care about them at the end to be satisfied with their fate. I especially liked how all of Sazed's work and doubts led to the final conclusion and that all of those religions were useful in the end.
