Raised the stakes appropriately after the first book, loved that the human/personal aspect wasn't lost even with the shift in focus to geo-politics. Enjoyed how the mystery about the prophecy was slowly unraveling on the backdrop of a seemingly lost battle. The final reveal was very interesting and I'm dying to know what the ramifications of it actually are!
