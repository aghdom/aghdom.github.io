Genuine, *playful* and kind. It's clear that this story and world are both a labor of love, a genuine passion project. The attention to detail and care put into the world-building are a personal highlight. 
The various inhabitants of Soronan Desert each have their own <abbr title="constructed language">*conlang*</abbr>, the various fauna and flora are well described and often illustrated. 
The recipes, poems and games of the various communities do a lot to make the world feel lived in and warm, inviting you to take part in it!

The themes of community, sharing of knowledge & learning to live in harmony with the world really resonated with me.
Highly recommended to anyone looking for a light & heart-warming story exploring these themes and a fantastical desert world!
