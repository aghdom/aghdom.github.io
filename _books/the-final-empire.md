Immediately got hooked on the premise of a heist style book, where the main goal is to *overthrow a "God Emperor"*! I love the constrained, but powerful magic system and how it interacts with the world! I did not expect how much I got invested in all of the characters. Very interested to learn what the foreshadowed issues that keep cropping up will turn out to be.
