Good summary of the problem, (unfortunately) focused primarily on the situation surrounding the US 2016 & 2020 elections, due to which it could age poorly. 
The proposed solutions aren't ground-breaking or novel, but they are thoroughly researched and also discuss potential hurdles or misuse of certain ones. As a law layman I enjoyed the analysis of the proposed laws that could help curb some if the disinformation problems, although I fear that a large chunk of it might become stale relatively fast, as it discusses whether a certain law might or might not pass US Supreme Court scrutiny with the current set of Justices.
Overall a good read for people not yet familiar with the problem & proposed solutions.
